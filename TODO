cmakeify
 - replace all makefiles
 - debug and release libs.  static and shared libs
 - ctest memory checks, etc
 - make test needs to rebuild everything
 - finish todos in config.cmake - a few adhoc test programs
perf counters
 - move to esb.  update http and tcp to use the same set of counters
 - revisit efficency of historical perf counter.  turn into a composite with an interval?  rename time series?
 - averaging counter should track variance
 - percentile counter
async dns client
 - start with caching sync impl and async interface.  cache according to the dns record ttl and LRU
 - move to ESB.  add unit test
 - common caching code.  intial async impl can use threadpool and gethostbyname
tcp stuff
 - make sure full duplex
 - track bps
 - move tcp echo client/server into ESB and turn into a unit test over loopback/same proc
http stuff
 - turn top-level client and server into a unit test over loopback (client->server and client->proxy->server)
logging
 - pretty print thread ids
 - filenames, not full paths
 - rotating file logger - batch into memory buffers and flush occasionally.  double buffer.  fill one while flush other.  if one to be filled is too small, drop messages
bootstrap config
 - reload when file changes or on SIGHUP.  ports, buffer sizes, etc
 - xds agent could just regenerate this, serializing updates and using atomic moves
 - could potentially break into multiple files for scalability, but then need cross-file atomic update mechanism.
 - journalling approach?  base bootstrap file.  log of incremental updates.   compress incremental updates to avoid
   filling disk
fix license - 3 levels of derivation
fix multimap or replace with stl
lockless datastructures - list.  hashmap.
incorporate and prefer atomic.h.
