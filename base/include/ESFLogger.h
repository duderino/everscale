/** ESFLoggers define the interface that any concrete logger must realize.
 *  ESFLoggers support selective logging by severity level.  The
 *  implementation of the log (i.e., flat file, console, syslog, shared memory)
 *  is left to the implementing subclasses.
 *  <p>
 *  Severity Levels:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li> Emergency.  System cannot function.
 *      <li> Alert.  Immediate intervention is required or else the system
 *           may stop functioning.
 *      <li> Critical.  Severe conditions exist, but the system can continue
 *           to function, perhaps at a reduced level.  Example:  Memory
 *           resources are low causing the system to slow the rate its willing
 *           to accept new tasks.  Critical conditions can affect many
 *           transactions.
 *      <li> Error.  Error conditions exist, but the system can continue to
 *           function.  Example:  An error processing a transaction occurred
 *           causing the loss of that transaction, but other transactions are
 *           unaffected.
 *      <li> Warning.  Possible error conditions exist, but the system can
 *           continue to function.  Example: An error processing a transaction
 *           occurred, but the transaction may still be completed.  Also, other
 *           transactions are unaffected.
 *      <li> Notice.  An important event has occurred that is part of the
 *           system's normal operation.  Example:  A module has started or
 *           shutdown.
 *      <li> Info.  An event has occurred that is part of the system's normal
 *           operation.  Example:  A transaction has been completed.
 *      <li> Debug.  Verbose output suitable for debugging.  Example:  A new
 *           request is received and complete information on its properties
 *           is logged.
 *  </ul>
 *  </p>
